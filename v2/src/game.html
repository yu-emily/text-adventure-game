Description: 
Text adventure game where player types in instructions to forward the story.

1. Create a multiple room area: have at least 9 areas and no more than 20 areas.
2. The player types in directions (for example: "east", "west", "north") and then will be taken to the next room. Current game location is also described.
3. The player picks up at least 5 items and uses that item in another room.

(2) use let and const
(3) include methods such as startsWith, endsWith, and includes.
(4) convert at least one function to an arrow function
(5) use at least one object literal
7. Use jQuery, Greensock or any other Javascript library in the game. 
8. Every room/area has its corresponding image.
9. Primary part of code should pass JSLint, ESLint, or JSHint.
10. Add sound effects.
11. Have a cheat-sheet at hand.

                <h3>Gameplay Walkthrough</h3>
                <p>Within this small town, there are various objects that the player can interact with.</p>
                <p>Some have purposes, some do not: the glass at the lighthouse, the mirror at the forest.</p>
                <p>Some are also used in a different way: A book is not used for reading, a key is not used to unlock a door.</p>
                <p>In a successful gameplay walkthrough, the player first looks underneath the mat to find a key. The door doesn't unlock upon using the key since it's already open. The player than wanders into a garden room and finds a book and a pair of spectacles.</p>
                <p>If the player takes both objects, the spectacle is used when the player notices a chair set on the staircase and decides to sit down. Sitting on the chair with the glasses on, the player sees a hidden message on the wall. The wall directs the player to go to see a teller.</p>
                <p>The book is used when the player enters the library and realizes that the stool is not tall enough for s/he to grab the shiny object and uses the book to help make that gap smaller. After a successful interaction within this scene, a brooch appears along with an invisible lock being revealed and attached to the book.</p>
                <p>When the player has both the brooch and lock, and goes to meet with the teller, s/he will receive cards that gives the player a clue on how to unlock the book. The book opens and reveals a pocket watch hidden in the cache.</p>
                <p>With the pocket watch in hand, the player then goes to the clock room. Using the key to rewind the clock and the pocket watch as a reference for the correct time, the player is transported to another room and has successfully finished the game.</p>
